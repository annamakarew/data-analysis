Proposal for Individual Analysis

1. What question are you trying to answer?
I am aiming to answer: Can drivers in NYC survive on base wages alone, or do they need to rely on tips to make a liveable wage?

2. Why is this question worth answering?
This question is important because it directly impacts the financial sustainability of Uber/Lyft drivers, who are typically classified as independent contractors. If tips are essential, it suggests that the base fares may not be sufficient for drivers to earn a reasonable living wage, potentially affecting driver retention and satisfaction. Furthermore, this analysis could be valuable to policymakers, and companies like Uber and Lyft. For example, if drivers are found to heavily rely on tips, it might prompt discussions about adjusting fare structures.

3. What is your hypothesis? What leads you towards that hypothesis?
My hypothesis is that drivers do rely on tips to make a liveable wage. My experience as a DoorDash driver leads me towards that hypothesis, but I am interested to see if I am wrong given that this dataset looks at a slightly different product, and a different region.

4. What is the primary dataset(s) you will use to answer the question?
The primary dataset I will use is the NYC FHV (Uber/Lyft) Trip Data Expanded (2019-2022) dataset from Kaggle.
